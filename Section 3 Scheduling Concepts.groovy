- Kube Scheduler, schedule pods to nodes
- every pod has a field called node name which isnt set when you create pod menifest file, k8s adds.
- Kube schedule looks at all the pods which do not have the 'node name' property set.
- If a pod does not have a node name set in the property, it schedule pods to a node. 
- if there is no scheduler you would need to manually assign pods to node yourself
     - so in the pod manifest, you can simply add the node name field and assign the pod to the node. 
- You can only specify the node name in creation time and not once created. 
- kubernetes wont allow you to modify the node name property of the pod after creation 
- Instead you can create a binding object and send post request to pod api. 
- if there is no scheduler, the pods will continue to be in a pending state. 

  
Manually schedule the pod on node01.
Delete and recreate the POD if necessary.

  nodeName: node01 ------------------Adding this allows you to manually specify the pod to a node, however do need to delete the pod and create file again.
    
Now schedule the same pod on the controlplane node.
Delete and recreate the POD if necessary.
