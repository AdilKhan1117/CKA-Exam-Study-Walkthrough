Scenerio:
- If you had 1 Master node and 3 worker nodes
- Worker 1 has 3 application on 2 application running on it, blue and green, if this worker node went down, application blue -
  would be fine since its also running on another worker node however cause green is only running on 1 worker node, users will be impacted, 
  what will happen?
- If the worker node,comes up quickly the kubelet will place the application on Worker 1 again.
- However if 5 min have passed the kubelet will terminate these pods. 
- of the pods were part of a replicaset, they are recreated on another worker node.
- The time it waits for a pod to come online, is called a 'Pod eviction timeout' default value of 5 min. 
- When a node goes offline, the master node waits 5 min to consider the worker node being dead. 
- When the node comes back online after the podeviction timeout, it comes back blank with no pods on it. 
- so since the green pod was not part of a replicaset, it would automatically disapear since it past the podeviction period and not part of the replicatset.
